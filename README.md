# 🛒 Ecomzy - E-Commerce Shopping Cart

A modern, responsive e-commerce shopping cart application built with React, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS. This project demonstrates a clean implementation of shopping cart functionality with state management and routing.

- 🎨 **Modern UI/UX** - Clean, responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- 🔄 **State Management** - Redux Toolkit for efficient state handling
- 🧭 **Client-side Routing** - React Router for seamless navigation

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **React 19** - Modern React with hooks
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast build tool
- **Redux Toolkit** - State management
- **React Router DOM** - Client-side routing
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **React Icons** - Icon library

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ecomzy
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Razorpay test payments

The checkout flow uses a Node/Express server so the Razorpay secret never reaches
the browser. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, add Razorpay Test Mode credentials
from the Razorpay dashboard, then run both processes:

```bash
npm run server
npm run dev
```

The Vite development server proxies `/api` requests to the payment server.
`POST /api/create-order` recalculates the amount from product IDs and quantities,
and `POST /api/verify-payment` verifies Razorpay's HMAC signature. Never commit
`.env` or use test credentials in production.

## 📱 Product Categories

The app includes products from the following categories:

## 🎨 Styling

The application uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling with:
- Responsive grid layouts
- Hover effects and transitions
- Custom color schemes (gray, green, red)

## 🔄 State Management

Redux Toolkit manages the cart state with the following actions:

Cart state includes:
- Product details (id, title, price, image, etc.)
- Quantity tracking for each product
- Automatic total calculation

## 🌐 Routing

The app uses React Router with two main routes:
- `/` - Home page (product catalog)
- `/cart` - Shopping cart page

## 🚧 Future Enhancements
